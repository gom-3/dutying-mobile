## Introduce
This service provides an easy and convenient work schedule creation environment for head nurses who felt inconvenience due to the existing difficult work schedule creation process, and by synchronizing the created work schedules, it eliminates the hassle of registering and checking cumbersome shift work.

## Platform
We provide a web service for head nurses and a mobile app for general nurses, solving their respective issues. By linking these two platforms into a single service, we eliminate inefficient tasks that previously occurred offline.

### Web 

Our web service provides head nurses with guidance based on scheduling constraints and a work schedule auto-completion feature, reducing the time and difficulty involved in creating work schedules.

### Mobile App (this repo)
General nurses can directly check the synchronized work schedules through the mobile app and even apply for leave. They can easily find out who they will be working with and who the shift handover will be from, without having to search through the entire Excel sheet. They can selectively sync with all calendars stored on the device, allowing them to manage all schedules through a single app.
